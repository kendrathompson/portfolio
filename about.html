	      		<p>I am a professional video editor, illustrator, and motion graphics designer. I completed a four-year degree in Media and Cultural Studies at Trent University in only three years through summer school and course overload. Throughout these three years I developed an understanding of media literacy through courses involving theatre, music, sociology, film, and television production.</p>

		      		<p>Post-graduation I worked as a content creator and video editor for a year. After this I applied to and was accepted into Interactive Media Management, a graduate certificate program at Algonquin College. This program has expanded my practical knowledge of media and design.</p>

		      		<p>With several years of experience in drama, visual arts, and video production, I am a confident and motivated creative individual. I have developed versatile skills in graphic design, website design/development, photography, motion graphic effects, and animation. I hope to become more pronounced in audio editing and use my newfound passion for animation and motion graphic effects to elevate my video content going forward.</p>
